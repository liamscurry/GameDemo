Movement dependence:
Independent Movement Via Raycasts:
Pros: Framerate independent
Cons: Breaks collisions with non terrain geometry

Dependent Movement Via Velocity:
Pros: Proper collisions with all objects
Cons: Movement slightly dependent on framerate from sloped surfaces and clamping. Solutions to this problems causes issues.
(1) Have horizontal movement constant and vertical movement change --> Unnatural movement on slopes
(2) Adjust position on clamping --> Potential collisions ignored
