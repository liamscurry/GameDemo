In order to set up a model to support IK, please reference the IK Rig Example Blender in this file
for the rig itself. The IK Rig Setup Example prefab here is the blender file but converted to support
this custom IK. In addition, use the files IKSystem and IKCopyRotation, which have their own
documentation in their files for how to set them up with the rig.

General steps to setup IK:
1) Apply the components and setup like in the IK Rig Setup Example prefab.
2) Alter flipPole, flipfoot and the local y rotation of any IK twist setups (IKCopyRotation components).
   This is complete when there are no twists at runtime without an animation.
3) Calibrate the basePoleAngle with a test animation, make sure that in atleast two points in the
   animation have correct pole rotation in Unity.
