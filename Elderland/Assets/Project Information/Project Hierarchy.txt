The following format should be used when creating assets/files in the project hierarchy window.
Before this date a parallel folder structure was used so materials were grouped together etc.
Only new assets and files going forward will follow this new structure unless a mass rearrangement is made.

For each asset (a prefab) have all associated scripts, materials, shaders etc in the same folder.
The folder it should be in should be titled the same as the prefab, and be a child folder of the prefabs folder.
One exception is to have resource prefabs be in a child folder of the Resources folder.
